# SMB_35
This is NOT a custom server for Super Mario Bros. 35

To try it out, simply copy the patch folder into `/atmosphere/exefs_patches` and play the game. The patch redirects the game to `smb35.ymar.dev:20000`, which is where the original creator is/was hosting the game server. It also disables all prepo and most bcat calls that are made by the game.

The dashboard is hosted at https://smb35.ymar.dev:20002. Here you can check out if anyone is currently playing the game.

If you encounter any bugs, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/kinnay/SMB35/issues) or [pull request](https://github.com/kinnay/SMB35/pulls) on github.

Again, this is not an SMB_35 custom server.
